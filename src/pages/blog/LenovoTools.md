### Lenovo Update Retriever

A program that enables an administrator to search for and download updates from the Lenovo Support site
Update Retriever enables you to download update packages from the Lenovo Help Center Web site to a network share repository folder. Your repository folder provides the storage for update packages. Once configured, System Update and Easy Update can search your repository for update packages. This allows greater control of the updates that are available over your network.
You can manually initiate the search for updates or schedule an automatic search for new packages on a specified time interval. If performing an automatic search, you can configure Update Retriever to provide notification when new updates are found so you can manually initiate the download or to automatically download the new updates and provide notification when downloading is complete.
